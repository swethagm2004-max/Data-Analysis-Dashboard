**Process**

Financial data was collected and stored in an Excel file with structured fields such as transactions, accounts, loans, and branch details.

The data was cleaned and prepared by checking for missing values, formatting dates, and ensuring data consistency.

The Excel dataset was imported into Power BI for data modeling and analysis.

Visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, KPI cards, and tables were created to build an interactive financial dashboard.

****Final Conclusion**

This project successfully demonstrates the use of Excel data for financial analysis and visualization using Power BI. By transforming raw financial and transactional data into an interactive dashboard, key insights related to transactions, loans, EMIs, and branch-wise performance were clearly identified. The dashboard enables efficient monitoring of financial activities, improves data understanding, and supports informed decision-making. Overall, the project highlights the importance of data analysis and visualization in effective financial management.

The dashboard was analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and key financial insights to support decision-making.
